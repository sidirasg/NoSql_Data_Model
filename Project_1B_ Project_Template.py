# #### Import Python packages 

# In[ ]:


# Import Python packages

# #### Creating list of filepaths to process original event csv data files

# In[ ]:


# checking your current working directory

# # Part II. Complete the Apache Cassandra coding portion of your project. 
# 
# ## Now you are ready to work with the CSV file titled <font color=red>event_datafile_new.csv</font>, located within the Workspace directory.  The event_datafile_new.csv contains the following columns: 
# - artist 
# - firstName of user
# - gender of user
# - item number in session
# - last name of user
# - length of the song
# - level (paid or free song)
# - location of the user
# - sessionId
# - song title
# - userId
# 
# The image below is a screenshot of what the denormalized data should appear like in the <font color=red>**event_datafile_new.csv**</font> after the code above is run:<br>

# ## Begin writing your Apache Cassandra code in the cells below

# #### Creating a Cluster

# In[ ]:


# This should make a connection to a Cassandra instance your local machine 
# (127.0.0.1)

# To establish connection and begin executing queries, need a session

# #### Create Keyspace

# In[ ]:


# TO-DO: Create a Keyspace 


# #### Set Keyspace

# In[ ]:


# TO-DO: Set KEYSPACE to the keyspace specified above


# ### Now we need to create tables to run the following queries. Remember, with Apache Cassandra you model the database tables on the queries you want to run.

# ## Create queries to ask the following three questions of the data
# 
# ### 1. Give me the artist, song title and song's length in the music app history that was heard during  sessionId = 338, and itemInSession  = 4
# 
# 
# ### 2. Give me only the following: name of artist, song (sorted by itemInSession) and user (first and last name) for userid = 10, sessionid = 182
#     
# 
# ### 3. Give me every user name (first and last) in my music app history who listened to the song 'All Hands Against His Own'
# 
# 
#

        query = "<ENTER INSERT STATEMENT HERE>"
        query = query + "<ASSIGN VALUES HERE>"
        ## TO-DO: Assign which column element should be assigned for each column in the INSERT statement.
        ## For e.g., to INSERT artist_name and user first_name, you would change the code below to `line[0], line[1]`
        session.execute(query, (line[#], line[#]))


# #### Do a SELECT to verify that the data have been inserted into each table

# In[ ]:


## TO-DO: Add in the SELECT statement to verify the data was entered into the table
