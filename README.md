**Project: Data Modeling with Cassandra**  <br><br>
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV 
files on user activity on the app.
As a data engineer  create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions, and wish to bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify 
to create the results.<br>
**Project Overview** <br>
 on data modeling with Apache Cassandra and complete an ETL pipeline using Python.<br> We  model the  data by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries.
<br>We are provided with part of the ETL pipeline that transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file to m0odel and 
insert data into Apache Cassandra tables.<br>
\ETL pipeline you'd need to process this data.

 **Datasets**
For this project, you'll be working with one dataset: event_data. The directory of CSV files partitioned by date. Here are examples of 
filepaths to two files in the dataset:

`event_data/2018-11-08-events.csv
event_data/2018-11-09-events.csv`
